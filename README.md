# JavaScript - Snowflakes

This assignment is based on this [video tutorial by Florin Pop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ARGxz_cU_o). To start this assignment, you should watch the video. I provided you with some starter HTML, CSS, and JS. The starter based on Florin's code, but it is not identical. You should spend some time studying with the code to make sure you understand it.

There are for inputs at the top of the page for this assignment, but right now they don't do anything. Your job is write the JavaScript required for those inputs to work correctly.

- **Snow VS Rain**: Make this slider change the ratio of snow to rain. As the slider moves to the left, more snow should be produced. As the slider moves to the right, more rain should be produced.
- **Quantity**: Make this slider increase or decrease the amount of rain drops or snowflakes produced every 50 milliseconds. When the slider is all the way to the left, zero drops/flakes should be produced. When the slider is all the way to the right, four drops/flakes should be produced.
- **Click Color:** Make it so that clicking a drop/snowflake changes its color to the value of this input.
- **Wind:** Make this slider cause drops/flakes to move left or right as they fall as if they were blown by wind. When the slider is all the way to the left, they should move left by 40% of the viewport width. When the slider is all the way to the right, they should move right by 40% of the viewport width. This only needs to affect newly created drops/flakes. It does not need to change any existing drops/flakes.
